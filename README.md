###Briefing 
Our application is called Deadline, a calendar management tool for students and professors. It is a system that would help its users, mainly students, to manage the coursework for their classes. All of the information, including homework and project assignments, lecture times, quizzes and exams, will be displayed on the main page of the application. Having all of the required information in a single place would save students' precious time. They won't have to go through multiple different course websites to look up the assignment deadlines for their classes anymore. As for professors, they would be able to update the class deadlines and all of the changes would be displayed on their students' calendars. 
The purpose of today’s session is to have you interact with our system. We’d like you to perform specific tasks and provide us with feedback. We especially want to know what worked well for you, what elements were confusing, what elements worked as you expected, etc. We are not allowed to explain how our system works, so please interact with the system as you’d do on an actual computer. 
OK, now we will present you with the tasks. *Hand index card with the card* Please take your time to read the tasks and let me know if you have any questions. You can start whenever you are ready.
